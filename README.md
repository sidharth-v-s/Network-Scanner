- Fast, multi-threaded scanning capabilities

### üîå Port Scanner
- Identify open ports on target systems
- Service and version detection
- Operating system fingerprinting when possible
- Pre-configured for common ports (21, 22, 23, 25, 53, 66, 80, 110, 443, 8000)

### üåê Web Directory Scanner
- Discover hidden directories and files on web servers
- Customizable with your own wordlists
- Threaded scanning for improved performance
- Easy-to-read results display



## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sidharth-v-s/Network-Scanner-Tool.git
   cd Network-Scanner-Tool
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Dependencies

- **DearPyGui**: For the modern GUI interface
- **python-nmap**: For network scanning capabilities
- **requests**: For HTTP requests and web directory scanning
- **concurrent.futures**: For multi-threading support
- **tkinter**: For file dialogs

## Usage

### Host Lookup
1. Select "Host Look Up" from the main menu
2. Enter the subnet to scan (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)
3. Click "Scan" and wait for the results

### Port Scanner
1. Select "Port Scanner" from the main menu
2. Enter the IP address to scan
3. Click "Scan" to begin port scanning

### Web Directory Scanner
1. Select "Web Subdirectory Finder" from the main menu
2. Enter the target URL (e.g., https://example.com)
3. Browse and select a wordlist file
4. Click "Scan" to begin the directory scan

## Customization

### Adding Custom Wordlists
You can use any text file as a wordlist for the Web Directory Scanner. Each line in the file should contain a directory or file name to check on the target website.

### Modifying Scanned Ports
To modify which ports are scanned, edit the `port_scanner` function in `code.py` and update the port list in the `np.scan()` function call.
